Ah, you're referring to Contract-Based Testing, sometimes also known as Consumer-Driven Contract Testing (CDC Testing). Contract-Based Testing ensures that services (typically microservices) fulfill the contracts they promise to consumers. The tool most commonly associated with this in the Spring ecosystem is **Spring Cloud Contract**.

For Contract-Based Testing, here's how you should approach it in your multi-project architecture:

1. **filejobstarter**: If this is responsible for listening to incoming messages from a Kafka topic, then you'd define contracts to ensure that it correctly processes valid messages and handles or rejects invalid ones. This would be a producer contract.

2. **opensearchfilejobstarter, postgresfilejobstarter, etc.**: These would also have producer contracts ensuring that they correctly interact with their respective databases and retrieve/process data as expected.

3. **SensAIBulkSearch**: This is the primary consumer of the starters. It would have consumer contracts to ensure that it can correctly call and interact with the functionalities provided by the starters. It would validate that it can correctly process the data retrieved from the starters and handle any potential issues or errors.

Here's a simplified example using Spring Cloud Contract for `SensAIBulkSearch` consuming a service from `opensearchfilejobstarter`:

### 1. Contract Definition (within `opensearchfilejobstarter`):

`src/test/resources/contracts/shouldReturnDataFromOpenSearch.groovy`:

```groovy
org.springframework.cloud.contract.spec.Contract.make {
    request {
        method 'GET'
        url '/opensearch/data'
    }
    response {
        status 200
        body([
            data: "some data from OpenSearch"
        ])
    }
}
```

### 2. Stub Generation (in `opensearchfilejobstarter`):

Spring Cloud Contract will automatically generate stubs based on your contracts. These stubs can be used by other projects (`SensAIBulkSearch`) to mock the service's behavior based on the contract during tests.

### 3. Consumer Test (within `SensAIBulkSearch`):

In `SensAIBulkSearch`, when writing tests, you can utilize the stubs generated by `opensearchfilejobstarter` to ensure your application behaves correctly when consuming the service.

```java
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(ids = "com.yourcompany:opensearchfilejobstarter:+:stubs:8080", stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.LOCAL)
public class SensAIBulkSearchTests {

    @Autowired
    private SomeService service;  // the service in SensAIBulkSearch that calls opensearchfilejobstarter

    @Test
    public void testDataRetrieval() {
        String data = service.getDataFromOpenSearch();
        assertEquals("some data from OpenSearch", data);
    }
}
```

In this structure, if any service (be it `filejobstarter`, `opensearchfilejobstarter`, or others) changes its behavior, the contract tests will fail, alerting you to the discrepancy. It ensures that producers and consumers always remain compatible.

This is a foundational example; actual implementation might vary based on the specifics of your setup and requirements.
