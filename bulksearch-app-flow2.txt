Of course! Let's break this down into a seamless interaction between `filejobstarter` (the main engine), `opensearchfilejobstarter` (data-source-specific functionalities), and `SensAIBulkSearch` (business logic and specific application implementation).

### Step-by-Step Interaction:

1. **Event Arrival**: 
   - An event, such as a message in a Kafka topic, triggers the `filejobstarter` due to its configuration as a KNative source application.
   - This activation can cause a new pod to spin up and process the event.

2. **Job Starter Handling**: 
   - Within `filejobstarter`, the incoming message is inspected to determine the type of job it represents. This could be based on certain metadata or the structure of the message.
   - Based on the identification, `filejobstarter` knows it has to invoke a particular job (let's say, the one related to `SensAIBulkSearch`).

3. **Invoking SensAIBulkSearch**:
   - `filejobstarter` invokes the `SensAIBulkSearch` job.
   - The job configuration within `SensAIBulkSearch` defines the sequence of steps. It knows that the first step, for instance, is to fetch data from OpenSearch.

4. **Opensearch Starter Integration**:
   - To interact with OpenSearch, `SensAIBulkSearch` leverages the functionalities provided by the `opensearchfilejobstarter`.
   - `opensearchfilejobstarter` contains predefined beans and configurations to establish a connection with OpenSearch, read data, and write data. These are automatically available to `SensAIBulkSearch` because it includes the `opensearchfilejobstarter` as a dependency.
   - Data is fetched from OpenSearch using the reader from `opensearchfilejobstarter`.

5. **Data Processing**:
   - Once the data is fetched, `SensAIBulkSearch` carries out any necessary transformations or business logic on the data.

6. **Writing Data Back** (if needed):
   - If the processed data needs to be written back to OpenSearch or another destination, `SensAIBulkSearch` leverages the writer from `opensearchfilejobstarter`.

7. **Job Completion**:
   - After all the steps of the job are executed, any post-processing activities (e.g., notifications, logging, or sending a response to another system) are performed.

8. **Scaling Down**:
   - Upon completion, KNative (due to its serverless capabilities) can scale down or terminate the pod that was running the `filejobstarter` instance, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

### Visualization:

Think of this as a layered approach:

- **Top Layer**: `filejobstarter` 
  - It's the first responder. It reacts to external triggers and determines which job or application should be executed. 

- **Middle Layer**: `SensAIBulkSearch` 
  - Contains the specific job definition and business logic. It decides what to do with the data and how to process it.

- **Bottom Layer**: `opensearchfilejobstarter` 
  - This is the utility belt. When `SensAIBulkSearch` needs to interact with OpenSearch, it dips into this layer and uses the tools and configurations provided here.

### Summary:

In essence, `filejobstarter` determines *when* and *what* to execute. The *what* in this case is `SensAIBulkSearch`. During its execution, `SensAIBulkSearch` leverages tools from `opensearchfilejobstarter` to interact with OpenSearch without concerning itself with the nuances of OpenSearch connectivity.
