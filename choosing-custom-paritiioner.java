I understand the importance of consistency and reliability in financial systems. When absolute guarantees about partitioning behavior are needed, the best approach is to take full control over the partitioning mechanism. Here's a detailed approach:

Custom Partitioner: This is the most common approach when you have specific partitioning needs that the default partitioner can't meet.

With a custom partitioner, you can specify the exact logic for partitioning. For your use case, you'd extract the "isin" part of the key and base your partitioning decision on it, ensuring that all messages with the same "isin" (regardless of the rest of the key) go to the same partition.
However, while implementing a custom partitioner, be careful to ensure that the partitioning is uniformly distributed among the available partitions to avoid creating hotspots.
External Service for Partition Lookup: If you want to avoid custom partitioning logic inside Kafka, you can externalize it.

Before sending a message, consult an external service (like a cache or a database) that provides a consistent mapping between "isin" values and partition numbers.
This service will ensure that the same "isin" always maps to the same partition.
This approach might introduce an overhead in the message production process due to the extra lookup step.
Kafka Streams: Kafka Streams allows you to define transformation topologies. If you're using Kafka Streams, you can handle the re-keying and repartitioning within your stream processing logic.

You'd rekey the message using only the "isin" as the key and then use through() to write it to an intermediate topic which will ensure repartitioning. After this step, all records with the same "isin" will be in the same partition. You can then further process these messages and output them to the final topic with your original composite key.
Remember, whichever approach you choose, you need to handle scenarios like changes in the number of partitions or changes in your partitioning logic to ensure that there's no disruption or inconsistency in the message flow. Also, always thoroughly test the chosen approach in a staging environment with real-world data patterns before deploying it to production.

kafka streams through() looks like an overhead i have to deal with a topic with 6 pariions and 8 billion records  creating a temporary topic will be a an over kill, when compared to custom partition

Absolutely, in situations with large data sets and where data movement can be costly in terms of both time and resources, introducing another topic via the through() method can indeed be overkill. It's always important to weigh the trade-offs.

Given the specifics you mentioned:

Volume of Data: You have 8 billion records spread across 6 partitions. Moving this to another topic just for repartitioning will double the storage requirements, increase the network I/O, and introduce additional latency to the processing.

Complexity: Introducing an intermediate topic means another entity to manage, monitor, and potentially troubleshoot. This adds to the overall complexity of the solution.

Data Consistency: Every time data moves, there's potential for issues. This can be from data corruption, data loss (though Kafka is pretty robust against this), or even just additional potential points of failure that might need recovery.

Given these considerations, a Custom Partitioner does seem like the better option in your case:

It gives you precise control over the partitioning logic.
It avoids unnecessary data movement.
It provides the flexibility to adapt the logic if your requirements change in the future.
When implementing the custom partitioner:

Make sure to test it exhaustively with data patterns you expect in production.
Monitor the distribution of data across partitions to ensure that you don't end up with skewed data that might overload a specific partition.
Make sure that the partitioning logic is deterministic â€“ the same "isin" should always result in the same partition (given the same number of partitions).
Lastly, as with any custom code, ensure there's good documentation and knowledge sharing among team members about how the custom partitioner works and how to modify or troubleshoot it if needed.
