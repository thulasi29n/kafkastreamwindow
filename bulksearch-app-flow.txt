Certainly! I'll break down the flow with numbers, and then I'll represent it textually since I cannot draw actual diagrams. However, you can use the textual representation to visualize or create a diagram using tools like Lucidchart, draw.io, or any other diagramming tool.

### Flow:

1. An event gets triggered. This could be a Kafka message, a Cloud event, or any other trigger you choose.
2. The **`filejobstarter`**'s event listener picks up this event.
3. This event listener invokes the Spring Batch job.
4. The Spring Batch job defined in **`SensAIBulkSearch`** starts executing.
5. The first step in this job is to fetch data.
6. **`SensAIBulkSearch`** leverages **`opensearchfilejobstarter`** to read from OpenSearch. This is where the OpenSearch client config and OpenSearch Reader come into play.
7. Data is fetched from OpenSearch.
8. **`SensAIBulkSearch`** processes or transforms this data based on its own business logic.
9. If the job involves writing data back:
    10. **`SensAIBulkSearch`** uses **`opensearchfilejobstarter`**'s OpenSearch Writer to write the processed data back to OpenSearch.
11. Once the job completes, **`filejobstarter`**'s response handler sends a response or notification, indicating the completion of the job.

You can take this textual representation and create a flowchart or block diagram. Each block or box in the diagram would represent a component, and the arrows would represent the flow of execution with numbers indicating the sequence.
